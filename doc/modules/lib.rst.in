Tools for the other modules.

.. warning::
    These tools have been designed primarily for internal use throughout the
    library and often work only in very specific situations (e.g.
    :func:`~nngt.lib.find_idx_nearest` works only on sorted arrays), so make
    sure you read their doc carefully before using them.
